In this image we see the annotation at the top nearest the red highlighed region representing the gene AMCG00015073. The light green region displays the bigwig file of the RNA sequence for early development. The dark green region is another bigwig file displaying the assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequence for early development. The blue region displays the bigwig file for the RNA sequence in late development. The light blue region displays the bigwig file for the assay for transposable accessible chromatin sequences in late development. The two pink bars represent open chromatin regions in late development. The purple bar represents a non coding open chromatin region in late development. Because the purple bar is non coding and is located at 1.416 kb and is outside of a region that is expressing a gene according to the annotation ~located at 1.428 kb, this is a potential region for an enhancer hypothetically for gene AMCG00015073.
